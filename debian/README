The Debian Package gerrit
----------------------------

I was to lazy to compile package from source with maven, so I've just packaged the .war package.
Package comes with defaults set to MySQL database and Bouncy Castle Crypto v144.
When asked to install required Bouncy Castle Crypto v144 say no, as it is already included as dependency.
